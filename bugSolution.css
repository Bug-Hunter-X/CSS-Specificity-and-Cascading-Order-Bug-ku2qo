The solution involves understanding how specificity and the cascading order work together in CSS:

```css
/* Style declaration order matters */
p {
  color: red; 
}

.container p {
  color: blue; 
}

.container .container p {
  color: green;
}

/* OR, make the selector more specific to enforce precedence */
.container p {
  color: blue; 
}

p {
  color: red;
}

.container .container p {
  color: green;
}
```

This version addresses the issue by ensuring the specificity and cascading order work as intended either through the order or by adding more specificity. The most specific selector will now correctly override others.
