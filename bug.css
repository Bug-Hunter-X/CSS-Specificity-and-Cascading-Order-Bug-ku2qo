The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an unusual issue related to the specificity of CSS selectors and the cascading order.  The unexpected outcome is that the "color: green;" rule is not applied to the paragraph element even though it appears to be more specific.

```css
.container p {
  color: blue; /*This style is applied unexpectedly*/
}

p {
  color: red; /*This style is applied unexpectedly*/
}

.container .container p {
  color: green; /*This style should be applied, but isn't */
}
```

This happens because the browser calculates specificity,  and in this instance,  `.container p` has the same specificity as `p`. The latter `p` selector is then applied because it is defined later in the CSS file (cascading order).
